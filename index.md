# Helm

**What is Helm?**  
Package manager and templating engine for a set of manifests

- The artifact produced by the Helm executable is a so-called chart file bundling the manifests that comprise the API resources of an application.
- Chart files can be distributed to a chart repository e.g. central chart repository and consumed from there (e.g., for running Grafana or PostgreSQL).
- At runtime, it replaces placeholders in YAML template files with actual, end-user defined values.
